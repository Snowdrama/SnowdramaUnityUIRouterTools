# Requirements & Disclaimer
In theory it works with earlier versions but I have tested against 2020.3.19f1(current LTS version) but I have it set to work with 2019.1 and over so there may be issues if you're using 2019. 

# Installation
* To install this package, use the Unity Package manager and click the + in the upper left.
